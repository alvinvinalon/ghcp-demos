  ## Prompt

  ```
  Analyze the following [code file or selected code] code and identify potential errors or bugs.
  [Paste code snippet or use #file<filename> to reference the code]
  Explain the error and suggest solutions.
  If there is an error message "[error message]", explain why it happens and how to resolve it.
  ```

  ## Expected Results and Explanation

  - The AI will analyze the code, identify potential issues, and provide explanations of the errors.
  - If an error message is provided, the AI will give context to the error and propose fixes.

**5. Code Translation and Conversion**

- **Description of the Prompt Use Case:** To convert code from one programming language or framework to another.

  ## Prompt

  ```
  Convert the following [source programming language] code to [target programming language].
  [Paste code snippet or use #file<filename> to reference the code]
  Maintain the functionality and logic.
  Explain any necessary changes.
  ```

  ## Expected Results and Explanation

  - The AI will produce equivalent code in the target language, preserving the original functionality.
  - It will explain any differences in syntax or semantics between the languages.
  - This is very useful for porting applications or migrating to new technologies.

**6. Generating Code Snippets and Patterns**

- **Description of the Prompt Use Case:** To quickly generate code snippets for common tasks or implement design patterns.

  ## Prompt

  ```
  Generate a [programming language] code snippet to [describe task, e.g., read a file, make an HTTP request].
  Or:
  Implement the [design pattern, e.g., Singleton, Observer] pattern in [programming language].
  Provide an example usage.
  ```

  ## Expected Results and Explanation

  - The AI will generate a ready-to-use code snippet that performs the specified task or implements the requested design pattern.
  - This accelerates development by providing boilerplate code and reducing the need to write code from scratch.

**7. API Integration and Usage**

- **Description of the Prompt Use Case:** To generate code for interacting with external APIs.

  ## Prompt

  ```
  Generate [programming language] code to interact with the [API name] API.
  Use the [API endpoint] endpoint to [describe action].
  Provide an example request and response.
  ```

  ## Expected Results and Explanation

  - The AI will generate code that makes API requests, handles responses, and parses data.
  - This simplifies API integration and reduces the learning curve for working with new APIs.

**8. Performance Optimization Suggestions**

- **Description of the Prompt Use Case:** To gain suggestions on how to improve the performance of code.

  ## Prompt

  ```
  Analyze the following [programming language] code for performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations.
  [Paste code snippet or use #file<filename> to reference the code]
  Focus on improving execution time and memory usage.
  Explain the potential benefits of each optimization.
  ```

  ## Expected Results and Explanation

  - The AI will return potential issues regarding performance, and offer solutions.
  - The AI will give explanations as to why the solutions will improve performance.
  - This will allow developers to produce more optimized code.

**9. Database Interaction Code Generation**

- **Description of the Prompt Use Case:** To generate database interaction code such as queries or ORM implementations.

  ## Prompt

  ```
  Generate [programming language] code to interact with a [database type] database using [database library/ORM].
